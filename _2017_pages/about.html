      <h2 class="second">Theme</h2>

      <p>Our theme, and what we're really about, is everyone having a good time and learning. That's why we put the effort in and work to make sure this event comes at no cost to any of our participants.</p>

      <h2 class="third">Mission</h2>

      <p>We are a not-for-profit event team working to provide students with an opportunity to dive deeper into the field of aerospace and mechatronics engineering through this hands-on team experience. In Canada, there are few opportunities to explore RC aviation and RC in general, and we want to be the ones who break this obstacle while having a lot of fun and helping participants develop essential engineering skills.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Vision</h2>

      <p>Overall, we envision bringing people together and get those thinking muscles running outside of your typical school setting, and we hope to push these experiences into a future in engineering.</p>
